INTERPRETATION GUIDE
--------------------

Moran's I Interpretation:
- Values range from -1 (perfect dispersion) to +1 (perfect clustering)
- Values near 0 indicate random spatial pattern
- Positive values indicate similar values cluster together
- Negative values indicate dissimilar values cluster together

Statistical Significance:
- p-value < 0.05 indicates statistically significant spatial pattern
- z-score > 1.96 or < -1.96 indicates significant clustering at 95% confidence

Hot Spot Analysis Interpretation:
- Hot Spots: Areas where high tree coverage clusters together
- Cold Spots: Areas where low tree coverage clusters together
- Confidence levels indicate strength of clustering:
  * 99.9%: Very strong evidence of clustering
  * 99%: Strong evidence of clustering
  * 95%: Moderate evidence of clustering

Implications:
- Clusters of high tree coverage (hot spots) may indicate:
  * Well-established neighborhoods with mature trees
  * Areas with successful tree planting programs
  * Parks and green spaces
- Clusters of low tree coverage (cold spots) may indicate:
  * Areas that need targeted tree planting efforts
  * Areas with recent development or urban density
  * Industrial or commercial zones
